description: "Password length is directly proportional to how fast your password can be cracked. Enforce a system of passwords at least 12 characters long and do not limit the length. Consider also using additional password rules such as the 3-random-word rule. The weakest part of a system is always the human element so educate your staff on password guidance, this guide is very informative and understandable: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/passwords/updating-your-approach."
