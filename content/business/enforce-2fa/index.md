title: Enforce Two-Factor Authentication across your Organisation.
date: "2015-05-01T22:12:03.284Z"
description: "Two-factor authentication is when two separate methods are used to verify a staff member's identity. The most common form would be an SMS Token, or Google Authenticator which will prompt a user to enter a 8-12 digit code in order to verify their identity. This should be used across all of your networks to ensure an attacker cannot run wild if they obtain credentials."
