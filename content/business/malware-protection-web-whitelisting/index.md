description: "This can seem trivial and extensive, but when a small number of sites are required by staff to perform day-to-day activites a whitelist can be extremely useful in protecting against malicious sites. You can choose to block these IPs using your router or a firewall. You could also consider finding databases or commonly whitelisted sites to reduce the time spent forming your own lists."
