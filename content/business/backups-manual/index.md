title: Manual backup to separate device, kept elsewhere
date: "2022-08-13T21:10:03.284Z"
description: "Always follow the 3-2-1 rule for manual backups: 3 different copies of data, 2 on-side on different media, and 1 copy kept off-site. The final step is vital, you want data outside of your organisation to allow you to revert to backups in case of an physical incident on-site. Consider using automatic cloud backups for an easier alternative."
