description: "Sandboxing is a term used to describe running processes or programs inside an isolated environment to analyse code or prevent the execution of malicious code inside your network. This is an advanced method and as a result be careful running any unknown code on your network, regardless of the environment. Only perform this if you are experienced and know what you are doing. Some anti-virus software already performs this, such as Windows Defender, so its importance is only applicable to large business with extensive networking capability."
