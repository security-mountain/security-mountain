description: "A common attack on a network is privilege escalation, use separate accounts to perform any admininstractive actions to compartmentalise your user accounts. Having multiple admin accounts with different levels of privilege and access will ensure that an attacker can only access small parts of your network if they obtained unauthorised access."
