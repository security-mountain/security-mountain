title: Check what access your apps have

description: "When you first install a new app, you are often required to enable permissions such as access to your Camera, Contacts, Microphone or Location Data. However, many of these are often superfluous to the primary function of the app. Look through the app permissions tab in your phone’s settings and review what access each app has. Consider denying some of them access to anything that you don’t think it actually needs."
