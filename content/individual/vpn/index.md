date: "2022-08-13T21:10:03.284Z"
description: "This is optional, but a VPN provides you with a very high level of data security against a range of parties: Apps, your ISP, public network monitors. Given the rise in remote working, and the flexibility of working out in public locations, having a VPN is particularly important when passing sensitive data (such as business information) across the internet. There are a broad range of options for VPNs that each come with different benefits and drawbacks, so consider doing some research into this to find an option that best suits your personal and professional requirements."
