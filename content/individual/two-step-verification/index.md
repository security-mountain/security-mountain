description: "Two-Factor authentication provides an added layer of security to ensure that only you have access to your accounts. Most banks require this already, while most email services and social media have the option available for new logins. Go into your accounts and check that this is enabled. You will likely then login using a combination of your password in the browser, and an authentication app on your phone."
