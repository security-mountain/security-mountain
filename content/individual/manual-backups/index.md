title: Manual backup to separate device, kept elsewhere
date: "2022-08-13T21:10:03.284Z"
description: "Follow the 3-2-1 Rule: For any important data, there should be 3 copies of the data, on 2 different media, with 1 copy being kept off site. The final step ensures your data is still safe in the case of non-cyber threats, such as theft or perhaps a house fire.
This might take a bit longer to put in place, but it is definitely worth doing. Consider buying a harddrive to keep your important data backups on. Store it somewhere accessible, but make sure to keep it separate from your main data location."
