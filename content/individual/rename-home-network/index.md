description: "Typical SSIDs are often common words like “Wireless” or “Default”. Having a default name potentially indicates to an attacker that you have a lower level of security on your network. This can make your network more of a target to someone looking at a selection of networks to potentially attack. Type in your router IP into your browser, and change your network name in settings after logging in."
