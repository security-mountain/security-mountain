description: "Smart devices and IoT devices will come with default passwords in order to meet minimum security standards. However, these passwords are often easy to guess and make your individual devices, and the network they are connected to, vulnerable. Go into the settings on your smart devices to change the default passwords. If your smart device doesnâ€™t have an option to do this, you may want to consider not using that device."
