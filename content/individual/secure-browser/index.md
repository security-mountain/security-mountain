description: "There are many services that offer a more secure browsing experience. By using one of these, you can limit the number of third-party trackers and apps that monitor your browsing. Some, like Brave, also provide extensions for even more secure Tor-based browsing. Try downloading a privacy-first web browser, and set it up to use a privacy-first search engine like DuckDuckGo. This search engine can be easily configured with personal location and search history settings."
