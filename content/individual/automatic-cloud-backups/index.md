description: "As with automatic software updating, automatic cloud backups will help keep your data in a safe, non-physical location, without you having to go to the effort of performing a manual backup. Ideally, you should have a cloud backup and a manual backup of all of your important data.
Microsoft, Google and many other cloud services offer automatic backup. Find the cloud service you use (or set one up) like Google Drive, and set it to automatically backup your data regularly."
