description: "Many apps, in particular social media, request personal and sensitive data on sign up. Check over your main accounts, and any new ones you sign up to, to make sure that you are the only one who is able to view information that you wouldnâ€™t want shared publicly, such as addresses or phone numbers. Head into the settings of your social media, and make sure that only the people you trust with or need your information have access to it."
