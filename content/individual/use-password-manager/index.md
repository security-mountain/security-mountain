title: Use a password manager
date: "2022-08-13T21:10:03.284Z"
description: "While this is not essential, password managers generate highly secure passwords and then store them for you. While it may take longer to access certain sites when you first log in to them (because the manager has to generate a new password), the passwords themselves will be much more secure, and you only have to remember a single master password that accesses the manager itself. The rest is taken care of for you."
