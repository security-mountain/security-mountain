description: "Most browsers ask if you want to save passwords in the browser itself. If you specify a master password for accessing the password list, then this can be a very secure solution to having lots of unique passwords. Whether you want to sync these passwords between different devices is up to you, but might be a good idea if each of those devices is well-secured in themselves."
