Simple or common passwords are very easy to crack, and anything that includes personal information, such as your petâ€™s name or date of birth, are quite easy to guess by anyone with some basic personal details on you. One useful method is to choose three random words, and use these three words with a number and a special character as the basis of your passwords. This will make sure they are sufficiently long, random and un-personal to be very secure. It is also much easier to remember than a random string of letters and numbers. Make sure your bank, email and primary apps all have a strong and unique password attached to them.","position":18}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/use-password-manager/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Use a password manager"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/wifi-firmware-updates/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Check for firmware updates to your WiFi router"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7881d26d-0350-579a-822c-d8a4d4064468","previousPostId":"4a25f1ba-40f9-5c15-9bbe-99d7d3ad5e5b","nextPostId":"5e79efb5-cebe-50eb-9ad4-1981f31b9f2b"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3000541721"]}
