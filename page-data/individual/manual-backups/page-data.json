The final step ensures your data is still safe in the case of non-cyber threats, such as theft or perhaps a house fire. This might take a bit longer to put in place, but it is definitely worth doing. Consider buying a harddrive to keep your important data backups on. Store it somewhere accessible, but make sure to keep it separate from your main data location.","position":5}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/firewall/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Check firewall"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/logging/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Create a log of all of the data that is important to you"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"dab0d7ba-14a5-5df2-88e0-82024ce60ae3","previousPostId":"f61422a3-5968-55c6-9290-ae494aa0af5c","nextPostId":"42cd6526-3da3-5f22-86e4-ae9eeb351936"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3000541721"]}
