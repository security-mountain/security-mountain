The final step ensures your data is still safe in the case of non-cyber threats, such as theft or perhaps a house fire. This might take a bit longer to put in place, but it is definitely worth doing. Consider buying a harddrive to keep your important data backups on. Store it somewhere accessible, but make sure to keep it separate from your main data location.","position":5}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/enable-strong-wifi-protocols/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Enable WiFi Protected Access and WPA2 encryption."}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/mobile-antivirus/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Install antivirus - particularly on mobile"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"dab0d7ba-14a5-5df2-88e0-82024ce60ae3","previousPostId":"471c29e4-6471-52b7-98fa-a0257ae0fcfc","nextPostId":"234fd10e-15e3-5e56-8aea-4cb0beceba79"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3000541721"]}
