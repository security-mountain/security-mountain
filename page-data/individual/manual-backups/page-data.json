The final step ensures your data is still safe in the case of non-cyber threats, such as theft or perhaps a house fire. This might take a bit longer to put in place, but it is definitely worth doing. Consider buying a harddrive to keep your important data backups on. Store it somewhere accessible, but make sure to keep it separate from your main data location.","position":15}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/mobile-antivirus/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Install antivirus - particularly on mobile"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/play-protect/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Play protect (for Android devices)"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"dab0d7ba-14a5-5df2-88e0-82024ce60ae3","previousPostId":"234fd10e-15e3-5e56-8aea-4cb0beceba79","nextPostId":"e939ca0e-bd98-58c1-99a0-a9ea7c94184b"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3000541721"]}
