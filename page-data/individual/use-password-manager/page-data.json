While it may take longer to access certain sites when you first log in to them (because the manager has to generate a new password), the passwords themselves will be much more secure, and you only have to remember a single master password that accesses the manager itself. The rest is taken care of for you.","position":17}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/software-updates/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Check all your software is up to date"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/two-step-verification/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Two step verification"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4a25f1ba-40f9-5c15-9bbe-99d7d3ad5e5b","previousPostId":"d7a33143-71a1-5fbf-bac9-48e530948ecb","nextPostId":"67898822-7f44-5164-a143-ec63e8413ccc"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3000541721"]}
