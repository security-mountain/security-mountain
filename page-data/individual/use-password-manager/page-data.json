While it may take longer to access certain sites when you first log in to them (because the manager has to generate a new password), the passwords themselves will be much more secure, and you only have to remember a single master password that accesses the manager itself. The rest is taken care of for you.","position":17}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/two-step-verification/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Two step verification"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/vpn/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Use a VPN"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4a25f1ba-40f9-5c15-9bbe-99d7d3ad5e5b","previousPostId":"67898822-7f44-5164-a143-ec63e8413ccc","nextPostId":"43d21bb1-2d8a-5db9-b3ae-faa3dbc2f200"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3000541721"]}
