Given the rise in remote working, and the flexibility of working out in public locations, having a VPN is particularly important when passing sensitive data (such as business information) across the internet. There are a broad range of options for VPNs that each come with different benefits and drawbacks, so consider doing some research into this to find an option that best suits your personal and professional requirements.","position":30}},{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/separate-networks/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 13, 2022","title":"Separate networks used by computers and IoT devices","description":"IoT devices are often in high demand, produced quickly with only minimal security measures. Your devices, on the other hand, often have higher levels of security. By placing IoT devices and computers on separate networks, you ensure that network access to your important devices is not compromised by the lesser security of your IoT devices. Here is a quick guide to do this, with a range of other useful info on securing IoT devices: https://www.cyclonis.com/setting-up-separate-network-for-iot-devices-how-to-do-it/","position":25}},{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/review-network-connections/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 13, 2022","title":"Review the devices attached to your home network","description":"By entering your default gateway IP into your browser, you can view and manage the devices that are attached to your home network. It is a good idea to check that these are only the devices you expect, and that you don’t see anything unfamiliar that may be taking advantage of your network.","position":23}},{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/wifi-firmware-updates/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 13, 2022","title":"Check for firmware updates to your WiFi router","description":"As with regular software updating, making sure your WiFi router is up to date will help keep you in line with the latest security measures on that device. This can be done through the “View Network Status” section of the Control Panel.","position":22}},{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/rename-home-network/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 13, 2022","title":"Rename your home WiFi network","description":"Typical SSIDs are often common words like “Wireless” or “Default”. Having a default name potentially indicates to an attacker that you have a lower level of security on your network. This can make your network more of a target to someone looking at a selection of networks to potentially attack. Type in your router IP into your browser, and change your network name in settings after logging in.","position":19}},{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/save-passwords-browser/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 13, 2022","title":"Save passwords in your browser","description":"Most browsers ask if you want to save passwords in the browser itself. If you specify a master password for accessing the password list, then this can be a very secure solution to having lots of unique passwords. Whether you want to sync these passwords between different devices is up to you, but might be a good idea if each of those devices is well-secured in themselves.","position":19}},{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/enable-strong-wifi-protocols/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 13, 2022","title":"Enable WiFi Protected Access and WPA2 encryption.","description":"Here is a quick guide on enabling these. https://blog.securitybrigade.com/wireless-security-how-to-enable-wep-and-wpa-encryption/ By doing this, you prevent unauthorised users from accessing the information being passed across your network.","position":18}},{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/two-step-verification/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 13, 2022","title":"Two step verification","description":"Two-Factor authentication provides an added layer of security to ensure that only you have access to your accounts. Most banks require this already, while most email services and social media have the option available for new logins. Go into your accounts and check that this is enabled. You will likely then login using a combination of your password in the browser, and an authentication app on your phone.","position":18}},{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/use-strong-passwords/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 13, 2022","title":"Strong passwords","description":"Having strong, unique and non-attributable passwords is vital to basic online security. Simple or common passwords are very easy to crack, and anything that includes personal information, such as your pet’s name or date of birth, are quite easy to guess by anyone with some basic personal details on you. One useful method is to choose three random words, and use these three words with a number and a special character as the basis of your passwords. This will make sure they are sufficiently long, random and un-personal to be very secure. It is also much easier to remember than a random string of letters and numbers. Make sure your bank, email and primary apps all have a strong and unique password attached to them.","position":18}},{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/change-network-password/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 13, 2022","title":"Change default router admin password","description":"As with smart devices, your router will have a default admin password. Gaining admin control of your router allows high-privilege access to many of the settings and devices on your network, so it is a good idea to make sure that this is changed to a non-standard password. Here are a set of steps to follow to change your router admin password: https://www.techradar.com/broadband/how-to-change-your-router-password","position":17}},{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/change-default-passwords/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 13, 2022","title":"Change default passwords on smart devices","description":"Smart devices and IoT devices will come with default passwords in order to meet minimum security standards. However, these passwords are often easy to guess and make your individual devices, and the network they are connected to, vulnerable. Go into the settings on your smart devices to change the default passwords. If your smart device doesn’t have an option to do this, you may want to consider not using that device.","position":17}},{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/use-password-manager/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 13, 2022","title":"Use a password manager","description":"While this is not essential, password managers generate highly secure passwords and then store them for you. While it may take longer to access certain sites when you first log in to them (because the manager has to generate a new password), the passwords themselves will be much more secure, and you only have to remember a single master password that accesses the manager itself. The rest is taken care of for you.","position":17}},{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/review-app-permissions/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 13, 2022","title":"Check what access your apps have","description":"When you first install a new app, you are often required to enable permissions such as access to your Camera, Contacts, Microphone or Location Data. However, many of these are often superfluous to the primary function of the app. Look through the app permissions tab in your phone’s settings and review what access each app has. Consider denying some of them access to anything that you don’t think it actually needs.","position":15}},{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/mobile-antivirus/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 13, 2022","title":"Install antivirus - particularly on mobile","description":"Not every mobile device, in particular older ones, comes with a sufficient antivirus.

","position":13}},{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/require-passcode/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 13, 2022","title":"Require a passcode to access your device","description":"As with the previous step, make sure that all your devices have at least one layer to prevent unwanted access. This could be a PIN, passcode, fingerprint or other biometric security mechanism. Make sure that any passwords or pins don’t correspond to known information like birthdays or names.","position":11}},{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/screen-autolock/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 13, 2022","title":"Screen to auto-lock after a period of inactivity","description":"You don’t want anyone to be able to access your devices if you leave them unattended.

Photos, posts and databases containing contact information are easier to find than you might think. So take this step to review how you are presented on the internet, and perhaps consider trimming down anything that you don’t want out there on the web.","position":9}},{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/review-privacy-settings/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 13, 2022","title":"Check privacy settings for apps","description":"Many apps, in particular social media, request personal and sensitive data on sign up. Check over your main accounts, and any new ones you sign up to, to make sure that you are the only one who is able to view information that you wouldn’t want shared publicly, such as addresses or phone numbers. Head into the settings of your social media, and make sure that only the people you trust with or need your information have access to it.","position":8}},{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/secure-browser/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 13, 2022","title":"Use a secure browser w/out trackers e.g brave","description":"There are many services that offer a more secure browsing experience. By using one of these, you can limit the number of third-party trackers and apps that monitor your browsing. Some, like Brave, also provide extensions for even more secure Tor-based browsing. Try downloading a privacy-first web browser, and set it up to use a privacy-first search engine like DuckDuckGo. This search engine can be easily configured with personal location and search history settings.","position":6}},{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/automatic-cloud-backups/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 13, 2022","title":"Automatic cloud backups","description":"As with automatic software updating, automatic cloud backups will help keep your data in a safe, non-physical location, without you having to go to the effort of performing a manual backup. Ideally, you should have a cloud backup and a manual backup of all of your important data. Microsoft, Google and many other cloud services offer automatic backup. Find the cloud service you use (or set one up) like Google Drive, and set it to automatically backup your data regularly.","position":5}},{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/manual-backups/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 13, 2022","title":"Manual backup to separate device, kept elsewhere","description":"Follow the 3-2-1 Rule: For any important data, there should be 3 copies of the data, on 2 different media, with 1 copy being kept off site. The final step ensures your data is still safe in the case of non-cyber threats, such as theft or perhaps a house fire. This might take a bit longer to put in place, but it is definitely worth doing. Consider buying a harddrive to keep your important data backups on. Store it somewhere accessible, but make sure to keep it separate from your main data location.","position":5}},{"fields":{"slug":"/individual/logging/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 13, 2022","title":"Create a log of all of the data that is important to you","description":"Having a list like this will allow you to keep tabs on how secure your important data is.
